# Weather app with React - assignment
An app that shows the current weather and 12-hour weather forecast for selected city. 

The app is bootstrapped from create-react-app

Run ```npm i``` or  ```yarn install``` before starting the app.

Run ```npm run dev``` to start in dev mode. 
Run ```npm run start:prod``` to start in production mode.

# Stuff to improve
Write better unit tests
Adapt better on larger screens - looks a bit stretched now
Improve layout to show more information without cluttering
